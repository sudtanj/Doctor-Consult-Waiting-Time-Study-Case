Question 2:
Suppose the case has changed – at the time John queues online, there are 14 patients ahead of him
and while Doctor A is not seeing any patient (i.e. Doctor A is available), Doctor B is currently seeing
the first patient, Lucas, who has been in the consultation room for the past 2 minutes.
Assuming that the average consultation times per patient for both doctors remain as 3 minutes and 4
minutes respectively, what will John’s estimated waiting time be when he joins the queue?

Answer:
approximately 51 minutes
