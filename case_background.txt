Background

You are working on an online queuing system for clinics that only accept walk-in patients. Through
this system, walk-in patients can now queue online and receive real-time updates to their waiting time.
Unlike appointments, patients who queue online cannot select their preferred time slots – the system
helps them secure a spot in the queue and provides real-time updates to their waiting time based on
their queue status.

The patients’ waiting times largely depend on (1) the average consultation time of their doctors, and
(2) the amount of persons ahead of them in the queue. The longer it takes for a doctor to consult each
patient, the longer the remaining patients in the queue have to wait. Similarly, the greater the amount
of persons ahead of a patient in the queue, the longer the patient has to wait.

There are many factors that can affect the consultation time. These include emergencies, additional
treatments, etc. Moreover, the average consultation time differs from doctor to doctor. For the purpose
of this case study, the average consultation time(s) will be given to you and you shall assume those
value(s) when working on your answers.
