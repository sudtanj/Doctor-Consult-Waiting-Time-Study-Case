Case Study 1
Clinic X has 1 doctor. The doctorâ€™s average consultation time is 3 minutes per patient. Currently, there
are 5 patients in the queue and the doctor is not seeing any patient. John decides to queue online and
he becomes the 6th patient in the queue, having 5 patients ahead of him. Since there are 5 patients
ahead and each taking 3 minutes on average, the waiting time for John is estimated to be 15 minutes.

Question 1:
When should the countdown in waiting time, i.e. from 15 minutes, start for John? The moment he
queues online, or when the doctor starts seeing the first patient in the queue?

Answer:
The countdown in waiting time for John should start when the doctor begins seeing the first patient in the queue.
The waiting time is calculated based on the average consultation time per patient, and it starts counting once the doctor starts
attending to patients. In this scenario, since there are 5 patients ahead of John, the waiting time of 15 minutes would commence
when the doctor begins seeing the first patient in the queue.
